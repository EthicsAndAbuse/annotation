# annotation
annotation Python scripts

Instructions:

To use filter.py, you will need to install pandas:

        'pip install pandas'


Once installed, have json samples in the same folder as filter & tag files 
From here, can run filter with:

        'python filter.py sample_10.json'


This will take a while, there is an active print command that is trigger randomly through which can help you see if still working.
Run tag.py to annotate code:

        'python tag.py precategorised_data.json <your name>'

if you don't feel like annotating the whole 500 things then enter q, which will save the annotations done so far.
Any problem, message on telegram
